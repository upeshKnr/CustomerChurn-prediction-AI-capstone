# 🤖 Customer Churn Prediction (AI Capstone Project)

This advanced project applies AI/Deep Learning approaches for customer churn prediction, simulating a real-world deployment pipeline.

## 📌 Objective
Predict customer churn using AI-driven techniques with a focus on end-to-end automation and accuracy optimization.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras (ANN model)
- sklearn (preprocessing, metrics)
- Streamlit (optional UI for demo)
- SHAP/Explainable AI (optional interpretability)

## 🧪 Workflow
- Deep EDA & Preprocessing
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Architecture
- Model Compilation, Training, Hyperparameter Tuning
- Evaluation using F1-Score, AUC, Precision-Recall
- Model Explainability (optional SHAP)

## ✅ Outcome
Built a DL-based model that outperforms classical models on selected metrics. Suitable for scaling and productionization.

## 📁 Structure
- `AI_Capstone_proj_CustomerChurn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full pipeline
